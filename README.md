# ISO8583Flow

**ISO8583Flow** is a server software that simulates a payment system using the ISO 8583 protocol. It includes a self-contained ISO8583 library that handles message parsing, construction, and communication. The server operates over TCP/IP, responding to incoming payment requests and simulating real-world transaction workflows.

## Features

- **ISO 8583 Protocol Support**: Full support for parsing, constructing, and responding to ISO 8583 messages.
- **Simulated Payment System**: Simulates the core functionality of payment systems, allowing for testing and development of transaction processing.
- **Self-Contained Library**: No external ISO8583 library is needed; all functionality is built directly into the project.
- **TCP/IP Server**: Operates as a server, accepting and responding to ISO 8583 requests via TCP/IP.
- **Custom Message Handling**: Easily extend the server to handle different ISO8583 message types and scenarios.
